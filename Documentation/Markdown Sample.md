Embedding images:
![Images](Images/ToRLogo.png) 
(The embedded image won't show up here if the file doesn't exist at the listed relative filepath) (additionally, it will automatically check an "Images" folder in the document's directory if the linked file is an image, so you could simply put `ToRLogo.png` instead of `Images/ToRLogo.png`)
