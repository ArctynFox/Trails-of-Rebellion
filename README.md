# Trails of Rebellion
 Unity project and relevant documentation for the development of Trails of Rebellion.

# Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repository
2. Install Unity 6000.0.31f1
3. Add the repository folder as a Unity project

The .gitignore is already set up to get rid of all unity files that don't need to be synced, which significantly reduces the amount of data that must be pushed and pulled. They will be auto-generated on your own device when you open the folder as a project in Unity, so no need to worry about having missing files.

# Making Commits
Please keep active development separate from the main branch. I am enforcing this using a Github rule which prevents pushing directly to the main branch. Any active development should be done on a separate branch, either as one development branch, or as different branches for different features. 

When a feature is finished, create a pull request to merge it with the main branch, then have someone else look over (and preferably test the changes in-project) for approval.
